# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-Techniques
This project aims to develop a simple and effective drowsiness detection system  using machine learning and computer vision. By monitoring the driverâ€™s eyes through  a webcam and analyzing signs like prolonged eye closure, the system can provide  timely alerts and help prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
